# The Delectable Engine

The Delectable Engine is built on the <a href="https://github.com/chryan/chewable">Chewable Framework</a> to tie in platform-specific functionality and useful external libraries.

# Delectable Features
Delectable implements the following key features:
* Level Management (supporting YAML and Binary level saving/loading)
* Windowing
* Mouse/Keyboard input systems
* YAML Serialization

Plans for graphics and sound integration are in the works.

Due to time constraints, the project is currently only supported on Windows (with projects files for MSVC2010). If you are interested in porting the engine to Mac/Linux, drop me an email.

Unit tests have been written for almost all features/utilities for the project. Technical documentation and tutorials will be added as soon as I have time to write some. In the meantime, http://dev.chryan.com/ has some articles related to implementation details of <a href="https://github.com/chryan/chewable">Chewable</a>.
